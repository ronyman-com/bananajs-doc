# Understanding the BananaJS Workspace System
Workspace as Your Output Hub
In BananaJS, the workspace directory serves as the central output location for all your project artifacts and generated files. Think of it as the controlled space where BananaJS organizes and manages your project's build results and development assets.

# Key Functions of the Workspace
1. Primary Project Output
Contains compiled/generated files from your BananaJS projects

Stores build artifacts in an organized structure

Serves as the deployment-ready directory

2. Implementation Workspace
Houses all active development projects

Maintains separation between different apps/tasks

Provides a unified structure for all BananaJS outputs

# Workspace Directory Structure
A typical workspace contains:


```bash
workspace/
├── my-app/          # Your main BananaJS project\
│   ├── dist/        # Production build output\
│   ├── .cache/      # Development cache files\
│   └── public/      # Static assets\
│
├── components/      # Shared component library\
├── tasks/           # Automation task outputs\
└── temp/            # Temporary working files\

```

Accessing Your Workspace
The workspace is automatically created when you:

```bash
banana create-app my-app
You can navigate to it directly:
```



```bash
cd workspace/my-app

Best Practices
Version Control: Only commit src/ files, not workspace outputs
Cross-Project Sharing: Use the workspace for shared assets between projects
Clean Regularly: Remove old builds to save space
Path References: Always use workspace-relative paths in configurations
Customizing Workspace Location
Override the default location in banana.config.js:
```


```bash

javascript
export default {
  workspace: {
    path: './custom-workspace-folder',
    structure: {
      dist: 'build',
      cache: '.temp-cache'
    }
  }
}
```
